Hi All,

Hope today's Git session was useful.

Here are the next steps for everyone:

Refer to the document VLabs Project Configuration - Part 1 for instructions on how to get started with gitlab / git setup
Create a new repository with your employee id
Commit the codebase to the new repository using git
Practice the commands given in Chapter 1-1, 1-2 and 1-3 in the Pro Git book (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) before moving on. These commands need to be performed in your specific repository only.
Also here are some useful links for reading further:
